I am in post-doc position at CNRS in the [ECO team](https://www.lirmm.fr/equipes/eco/) in Montpellier, France.

My research theme is computational number theory. Currentely, I work on the problem of computing class groups in quadratic number fields and I have a high interest in lattice-based cryptography.

I defended my thesis entitled "the discrete logarithm problem in extensions of finite fields" on december 2024 at Inria-Nancy, France.

# New results
A work with Cécile Pierrot and Emmanuel Thomé on using Galois automorphisms in the Tower Number Field Sieve will be made public soon.
We have exciting results that lead to significant accelerations in the linear algebra step. These accelerations allow significant and practical improvements in attacks against pairings.

# Sieve riddle
There are 100 closed doors numbered from 1 to 100. Begin at door 1 and open all the doors multiple of 1 (all doors). Go to number 2 and close all the doors multiple of 2. Go to number 3 and change the state of the doors multiple of 3. Go to number 4 ... until door 100. Which of the doors are open at the end ?
